#Codebook

This script creates a "tidy" dataset given a set of motion tracking data collected from smart phones.

The project's goal is to organize the data into a "tidy" dataset: 

1. One variable per column
2. One observation per row
3. One type of obserational unit per table

# Data Set Information

The data is collected from Samsung Galaxy S II smart phones worn by 30 volunteers aged 19-48 years old. 
The data takes the form of 3 dimensional linear acceleration and angular velocity. 

The data relevant to this project are stored in these text files:
* X_test.txt 
* y_text.txt
* subject_test.txt
* X_train.txt
* y_train.txt
* subject_train.txt
* features.txt
* activity_labels.txt


mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
